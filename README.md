# Project Ideas

**64 real-world projects with step-by-step roadmaps.** No scaffolding. No magic. Just you, a problem, and the next tool you need.

🌐 **[Browse the roadmaps →](https://nst-sdc.github.io/project-ideas/)**

## What is this?

A collection of project roadmaps designed for students who want to build real things from scratch. Each project starts with the absolute minimum — an input and a button, a canvas and a click — and grows one requirement at a time.

You don't learn tools because a syllabus told you to. You learn them because your app broke and you need to fix it.

## Categories

| Category | Projects | What you'll build |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| [Web Applications](https://nst-sdc.github.io/project-ideas/web/) | 16 | Full-stack apps, APIs, real-time systems |
| [Creative & Visual](https://nst-sdc.github.io/project-ideas/creative/) | 14 | Drawing tools, generators, audio/video pipelines |

## Every roadmap includes

- **Metadata** — difficulty, team size, estimated time, prerequisites
- **"Built by"** — real companies that charge money for the same thing you're building
- **Skills earned** — specific, resume-worthy technical skills
- **Step-by-step guide** — each step introduces one new concept, motivated by a real problem
- **Time estimates** — realistic for students learning as they go
- **Resources** — links to official docs, MDN, GitHub repos
- **"Where to go from here"** — because the project never really ends
