# Cluster Projects

Projects designed to run on and leverage the NST Compute Cluster. These teach distributed systems, infrastructure, and platform engineering.

| Project | Starting Point | You'll Eventually Learn |
|---|---|---|
| [Mini Cloud Platform](./cloud-platform) | Run a container on one node | Isolation, quotas, multi-tenancy, networking |
| [App Hosting Portal](./hosting-portal) | Deploy from a Git URL | Build pipelines, rollbacks, audit logs |
| [Distributed Job Queue](./job-queue) | Worker picks task from a list | Distribution, retries, priorities, monitoring |
| [Key-Value Store](./kv-store) | HashMap with a TCP interface | Replication, partitioning, consensus |
| [Config & Secrets](./config-secrets) | Serve config from a file over HTTP | Encryption, versioning, access control, push updates |
| [Cluster Scheduler](./scheduler) | Place a task on the least-loaded node | Constraints, affinity, preemption, health checks |
| [Internal Dev Platform](./dev-platform) | A dashboard listing services | User management, provisioning, templates |
| [Observability Stack](./observability) | Collect one metric per second | Time-series DB, dashboards, alerting, traces |
| [CI/CD System](./cicd) | Run a shell script on git push | Containers, parallelism, artifacts, deploy gates |
| [Event Streaming](./event-streaming) | Publish and subscribe to a topic | Partitions, consumer groups, replay, persistence |
| [Distributed File Storage](./file-storage) | Store a file across two nodes | Replication, consistency, metadata, API |
| [Batch Processing](./batch-processing) | Split a file and process chunks | Map-reduce, scheduling, fault tolerance |
| [Collaborative Editor](./collaborative-editor) | Two textareas synced via WebSocket | Conflict resolution, CRDTs, persistence, cursors |
| [Multiplayer Game Server](./game-server) | Two players in a shared space | Lobbies, matchmaking, state sync, latency |
| [Chaos Engineering Tool](./chaos-tool) | Kill a random pod | Network faults, latency injection, recovery testing |
| [Debug & Recovery Simulator](./debug-simulator) | A broken config that students must fix | Scenario generation, scoring, hints |
