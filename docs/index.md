    details: You don't learn localStorage because a textbook says so. You learn it because your data disappeared on reload.
  - title: Minimum Viable First
    details: Every project starts with the absolute bare minimum. An input and a button. A canvas and a click. Then it grows.
  - title: Real Problems, Real Tools
    details: Each step introduces a tool because you need it, not because it's next in a syllabus.

## How to use these roadmaps

Each project page is a sequence of steps. Every step follows the same pattern:

1. **You have something working** (even if it's tiny)
2. **You notice a problem** (data disappears, it's slow, it looks ugly, it doesn't work on your phone)
3. **You figure out the tool** that solves that problem
4. **You build the next version**

Do not skip steps. The point is not to reach the end — it's to understand why each piece exists.

Start with whatever project interests you. If you get stuck, that's the learning happening.
